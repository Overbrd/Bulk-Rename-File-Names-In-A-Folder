# Bulk Rename All File Names in a Folder

Bulk file rename utility for Windows.

GUI allows you to open a folder (including subfolders option also available).

Once you open a folder it displays the folder contents alphabetized by file name only.

It has an input box to choose the characters to replace and another input box to choose what characters to replace with.

It has a third preview box which displays a real-time output of the proposed changes you are about to make.

Once you are happy with the changes you click an OK button and a warning confirmation popup box appears confirming you are about to change file names and that the change cannot be undone.

Once you click OK the filenames are all changed simultaneously.
